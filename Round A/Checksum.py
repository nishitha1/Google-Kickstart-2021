# Find a minimum weight subset of edges that breaks all cycles.
# The problem of finding a minimum weight cycle breaking edge set is equivalent to the well known problem of 
# finding a maximum weight spanning forest of G, except that we would build the complement set of edges to keep rather than the set of edges to remove.
