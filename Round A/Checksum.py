# finding a minimum weight subset of edges that breaks all cycles.
#the problem of finding a minimum weight cycle breaking 
#edge set is equivalent to the well known problem of 
#finding a maximum weight spanning forest of G, 
#except that we would build the complement set 
#of edges to keep rather than the set of edges to remove.
